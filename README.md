# How to play:
# This is a single-player game.
# When the page is loaded, you will see a "Start" button and the game area below. The game has 5 rounds, increasing in difficulty each round.
# Click on "Start" to start the game.
# Round one will start immediately. You have 6 seconds to memorize the number of red shapes, blue shapes, circles, and triangles in the game area. To increase the challenge, there won't be a timer displayed.
# Afterwards, the shapes disappear, and you will input these numbers. Click the "Submit" button to finalize your answers. 
# Next, you will find out how many points you earned. The number of points earned that round is the number of questions correct times the round number.
# Click the "Next Round" button to immediately start the next round. Each round increases the number of shapes
# The first two rounds give you 6 seconds. Rounds 3 and 4 give you 9 seconds. Round 5 is 12 seconds. 



# This game was inspired by trivia games, but instead of using real-world knowlegde, the player memorizes shapes and answers questions 
# It uses HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

# Issues I ran into:
# The game doesn't have a pause button while the shapes are displaying. There is a setTimeout function used for the shapes, so interrupting the setTimeout function will create problems in the code.
